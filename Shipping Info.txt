Delivery Information for International Buyers:

At our whistle company, we are committed to providing our customers with prompt and efficient delivery service. We ship our products worldwide. However, please note that international deliveries may be subject to import duties and taxes.

Import duties and taxes are not included in the price of the whistle or shipping costs. These fees are determined by the customs office of the destination country and will vary based on the value of the product and its classification under the Harmonized System (HS) code.

It is the responsibility of the international buyer to pay any import duties or taxes that may be incurred. These fees are collected by the shipping carrier or a government agency upon delivery. We recommend researching the import regulations and fees for your country before placing your order. Consulting with a customs broker or freight forwarder can also assist you with the import process.

Please note that failure to pay any import duties or taxes due can result in the delay or seizure of your shipment. Additionally, in some cases, if the import duty rate is higher than the domestic production rate, the government may impose countervailing duty.

We will provide you with all the necessary documents, such as an invoice and packing list, to facilitate customs clearance and expedite the process. However, please be aware that we are not responsible for any delays caused by the customs clearance process.

To avoid any unexpected charges, we recommend checking your country's regulations and tariffs on the product before placing your order. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
